## About

# Hi, my name is Jack and I am currently studying for the PG-Cert in Data Science. This e-Portfolio is specifically for the Deciphering Big Data module.

Please note that this is very much a work in progress - I'm hoping to build the portfolio up as much as possible as the module progresses and learn how to make the most of markup along the way!
